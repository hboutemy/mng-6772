# Explanation

The project's [`pom.xml`](pom.xml) overrides `central` repository to point to [`repo/`](repo/) local directory.

That reactor-POM defined repository permits to download [`bom-a:0.1` dependencyManagement import](repo/org/apache/maven/its/mng6772/bom-a/0.1/bom-a-0.1.pom).

That bom-a tries to download [`bom-b:0.1` dependencyManagement import](repo/org/apache/maven/its/mng6772/bom-b/0.1/bom-b-0.1.pom), which fails: `bom-a` has overridden `central` definition.

# Issue

If `bom-a` was a "normal" dependency, overriding `central` would have beed ignored: only reactor's build POM can override repository urls (see [repository order](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html#repository-order)).

But `bom-a` is a dependencyManagement import, that is not loaded as part of dependencies resolution (when required by a plugin), but loaded during [effective model building](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.8.1/maven-model-builder/): the code to resolve such POM is copied from code to resolve parent POM. It seems it applies reactor's build POM resolution rules, when it should probably use dependency resolution rules...
